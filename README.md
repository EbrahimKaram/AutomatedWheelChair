# AutomatedWheelChair
The project was created in collaboration with Hassan Hmedi and Rayan A. Al Sayed Ali. For any information please go through the useful documents section of the repository.  

One of my first projects done with hardware. The system was a toy car that would accelerate and deaccelerate according to information given from its sensors.  

*	Ultrasound 1: to detect obstacles in front of the toy car 
*	Ultrasound 2: to detect gaps or an edge of a road/ table before a car
*	Accelerometer: to detect the inclination of the vehicle
